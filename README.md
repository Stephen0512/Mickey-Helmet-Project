# Mickey-Helmet-Project
A project done in the school Fablab Program

This is my final project of the school Fablab program. In this project, I combined all the skills I learnt in this program to produce a mickey-mouse helmet. Starting from building the appearance of the helmet, I used SolidWorks software to design the model of the helmet. After adjusting for hunderds of times, I printed it out using the 3D printer given by the school. As I continued with my project, the next step I taken is trying to use three Arduino mainboards to control the 8*24 LED panel, which represents the eyes of the mickey mouse. I programmed the code using in the Arduino mainboards in order to let the diodes flash randomly. At last, I used the laser cutter to create the protect case of the helmet which gives the helmet a fixed stands.

In order to further improve my project, I should change the code using in the three Arduino mainboards to it more complex. Instead of asking the diodes to flash randomly, I can enables the LED panel to show more useful information, such as: date and time.
