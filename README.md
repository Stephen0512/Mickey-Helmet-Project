# Mickey-Helmet-Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Mickey-Helmet-Project, my final project for the Fablab program at Ulink College of Suzhou Industrial Park. The project combines skills learned throughout the course, culminating in the creation of a Mickey Mouse-inspired helmet. The design incorporates 3D modeling, LED programming, and laser cutting technologies.

## Key Features
- **3D Modeled Helmet:** Crafted using SolidWorks to achieve an accurate and functional Mickey Mouse-themed design.
- **LED Display Eyes:** Utilizes an 8*24 LED panel controlled by Arduino mainboards, offering dynamic visual expressions.
- **Laser-Cut Protective Case:** Provides durability and stability to the helmet, along with a professional finish.

## Development Steps
### Design
- **SolidWorks:** Initial design and numerous adjustments were made using SolidWorks to perfect the helmet's appearance and functionality.
### Fabrication
- **3D Printing:** The model was brought into the physical world using a 3D printer provided by the school.
- **Laser Cutting:** The helmet's protective case was fashioned using a laser cutter, reinforcing the structure.
### Programming
- **Arduino Control:** Three Arduino mainboards were programmed to manage the LED panels. Initially set to flash randomly, simulating Mickey Mouse's eyes.

## Suggested Improvements
- **Enhanced LED Functionality:** Revise the Arduino code to make the LED display more interactive, such as showing the date and time, instead of random flashing.
